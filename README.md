# calendar-wu
Why is the font so blurry? :(
## Bugs
- duplicate events from input file do not work
- after a while, the time line will sweep a portion of the drawing. <img src=“bugs/timesweep.png”>. 
- adjusting date for an event will not work graphically
- description does not save after being edited for an event

## Features
- displays days within any given month and year in a grid
- EventCollection stores events
- previous, today, next buttons can show previous and future days/weeks/months/year
- today always returns user to current day/week/month/year
