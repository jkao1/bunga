# calendar-wu
Why is the font so blurry? :(
## Bugs
- after a while, the time line will sweep a portion of the drawing. <img src=“bugs/timesweep.png”>. 
- adjusting date for an event will not work graphically
- in the DAY layout, clicking on an event in the timeline should automatically update the sidebar. However, the sidebar will not update until the event is updated
## Features
- displays days within any given month and year in a grid
- a BST to get events at lightning speeds
- previous & next buttons can show previous and future days/weeks/months/year
- today always returns user to current day/week/month/year
